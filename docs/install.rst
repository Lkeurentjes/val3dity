Installation
============


Windows executable
------------------

For Windows, we offer an `executable <https://github.com/tudelft3d/val3dity/releases>`_, and there's a Visual Studio project code in the folder ``vs_build``, although installing the dependencies is slightly more complex than for macOS/Linux.


macOS & Linux: you need to compile
----------------------------------

The details to compile and use val3dity are on `GitHub <https://github.com/tudelft3d/val3dity#installation-of-the-command-line-tool>`_.


Web-application
---------------

If you don't want to go through the troubles of compiling and/or installing val3dity, we suggest you use the `web application <http://geovalidation.bk.tudelft.nl/val3dity>`_. 
Simply upload your file to our server and get a validation report back.
We delete the file as soon as it has been validated.
However, a file is limited to 50MB.


Using val3dity as a library
---------------------------

val3dity can be compiled and used as a library, see `the instructions <https://github.com/tudelft3d/val3dity#using-val3dity-as-a-library>`_

Also, there is a simple example of how to use it in `./demo_lib` with instructions to compile it.


Python bindings
---------------

It is possible to use val3dity with Python, see `val3ditypy <https://github.com/tudelft3d/val3ditypy/>`_.
