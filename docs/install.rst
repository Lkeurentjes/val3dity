Installation
============


Windows
-------

For Windows, we offer an `executable <https://github.com/tudelft3d/val3dity/releases>`_, and there's a Visual Studio project code in the folder ``vs_build``, although installing the dependencies is slightly more complex than for macOS/Linux.


Web-application
---------------

If you don't want to go through the troubles of compiling and/or installing val3dity, we suggest you use the `web application <http://geovalidation.bk.tudelft.nl/val3dity>`_. 
Simply upload your file to our server and get a validation report back.
We delete the file as soon as it has been validated.
However, a file is limited to 50MB.



Compile (for macOS & Linux use)
-------------------------------

The details to compile and use val3dity are on `GitHub <https://github.com/tudelft3d/val3dity#installation-of-the-command-line-tool>`_.
